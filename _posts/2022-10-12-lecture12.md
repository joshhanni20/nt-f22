* What are definitions of "Parable"?
    * A parable is technically an extended simile.
    * From the Greek - A placing of one thing by the side of another, juxtaposition, comparison of one thing with another, likeness, similitude.
    * Parables are short stories in which divine truth is presented by comparison with material things.

* What lessons can we learn from Jesus on the Parable of the Sower?
    * It's more a parable of the soils.
    * Meanings:
        * Seeds by the way side (v.4) - "When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not" (v.19)
        * Fowls which come and devour (v.4) - "wicked one...and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart" (v.19)
        * Seeds in stony places with no root (v.5) - "he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; Yet hath he not root in himself" (v.20-21)
        * Sun which scorches seeds (v.6) - "tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended" (v. 21)
        * Seeds among thorns (v.7) - "he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful" (v.22)
        * Seeds in good ground (v.8) - "he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty" (v.23)

* What connections can we make between the parable of the sower and Lehi's vision?
    * First group commenced on the path to the tree but strayed because they were blinded by the mists of darkness (1 Ne 8:21-23) = **Seeds in stony places with no root (Matthew 13:5)**
    * Second made it to the tree, but after they had partook they were ashamed because of mockery and fell away (1 Ne 8:24-28) = **Seeds among thorns (Matthew 13:7)**
    * Third group made it to the tree and gave no heed to those mocking them (1 Ne 8:30,33) = **Seeds in good ground (Matthew 13:8)**
    * Fourth group never sought the tree at all (1 Ne 8:30-33) = **Seeds by the way side (Matthew 13:4)**
