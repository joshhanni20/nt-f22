* What is the meaning of the word "abide" and its significance in John 15?
    * "Abide" means "to remain/endure". This is significant because a branch is dead/useless unless it remains attached to the vine.
        * "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed" (John 8:31)
        * "It means to 'stay--but stay *forever*'" -Elder Holland

* What is the symbolism behind the "vine" analogy in John 15?
    * A branch is dead/useless unless it remains attached to the vine.
    * Jesus may have given this discourse as they walk toward the Mount of Olives.

* What is meant by "intercessory" prayer in John 17?
    * An intercessor is someone who advocates, mediates, or pleads in behalf of another.
    * In essence, Jesus is praying in behalf of everyone.

* What insight can we gain from the Greek word translated as "know" in John 17:3?
    * It is from the word *ginosko*, which can be translated "to know by experience"
    * It is not from the word *oida*, which is "to know facts/data"
