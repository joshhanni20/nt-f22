* What characteristic of the Savior is emphasized in the story of the "woman of faith" who is healed?
* What historical/cultural details enhance our reading of the parable of the Good Samaritan?
    * Samaritans
        * The people who inhabited Samaria after the captivity of the northern kingdom of Israel. They were the descendants of (1) foreign colonists placed there by kings of Assyria and Babylonia (2) Israelites who escaped at the time of the captivity. The population was therefore partly Israelite and partly gentile. Their religion was also of a mixed character, though they claimed, as worshippers of Jehovah, to have a share in the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem. This claim not being allowed, they became, as the books of Ezra and Nehemiah show, bitter opponents of the Jews, and started a rival temple of their own on Mount Gerizim.
    * Jerusalem to Jericho - 1900 ft drop
    * Terrain is barren and dangerous
    * Tensions between Jews and Samaritans
    * Priests and Levites worked in the temple
    * Contact with blood/corpse = ritually unclean
    * 2 "pence" (denarii) = 2 months room/board
* Which question drew out the parable of the Good Samaritan?
    * And who is my neighbor?
