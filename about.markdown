This website serves as a place for me to record my notes from my Religion A 211 class.

I've divided this site into pages, and each one corresponds to an individual lecture given in the class. I've simply written my notes for each lecture on the pages.

The source code for the website can be found [here](https://github.com/joshhanni20/nt-f22)
